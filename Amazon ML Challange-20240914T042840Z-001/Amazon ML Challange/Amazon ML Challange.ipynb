This capability is crucial in fields like healthcare, e-commerce, and content moderation, where precise product information is vital. As digital marketplaces expand, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, making it essential to obtain key details directly from images. These images provide important information such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, dimensions, and many more, which are critical for digital stores.\n","Data Description:\n","\n","The dataset consists of the following columns:\n","\n","    index: A unique identifier (ID) for the data sample.\n","    image_link: Public URL where the product image is available for download. Example link - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg  To download images, use the download_images function from src/utils.py. See sample code in src/test.ipynb.\n","    group_id: Category code of the product.\n","    entity_name: Product entity name. For example, “item_weight”.\n","    entity_value: Product entity value. For example, “34 gram”.\n","\n","Note: For test.csv, you will not see the column entity_value as it is the target variable.\n","Output Format:\n","\n","The output file should be a CSV with 2 columns:\n","\n","    index: The unique identifier (ID) of the data sample. Note that the index should match the test record index.\n","    prediction: A string which should have the following format: “x unit” where x is a float number in standard formatting and unit is one of the allowed units (allowed units are mentioned in the Appendix). The two values should be concatenated and have a space between them.\n","    For example: “2 gram”, “12.5 centimetre”, “2.56 ounce” are valid.\n","    Invalid cases: “2 gms”, “60 ounce/1.7 kilogram”, “2.2e2 kilogram”, etc.\n","    Note: Make sure to output a prediction for all indices. If no value is found in the image for any test sample, return an empty string, i.e., “”. If you have less/more number of output samples in the output file as compared to test.csv, your output won’t be evaluated.\n","\n","File Descriptions:\n","\n","Source Files:\n","\n","    src/sanity.py: Sanity checker to ensure that the final output file passes all formatting checks.\n","    Note: The script will not check if fewer/more number of predictions are present compared to the test file. See sample code in src/test.ipynb.\n","    src/utils.py: Contains helper functions for downloading images from the image_link.\n","    src/constants.py: Contains the allowed units for each entity type.\n","    sample_code.py: A sample dummy code that can generate an output file in the given format. Usage of this file is optional.\n","\n","Dataset Files:\n","\n","    dataset/train.csv: Training file with labels (entity_value).\n","    dataset/test.csv: Test file without output labels (entity_value). Generate predictions using your model/solution on this file's data and format the output file to match sample_test_out.csv (Refer to the \"Output Format\" section above).\n","    dataset/sample_test.csv: Sample test input file.\n","    dataset/sample_test_out.csv: Sample outputs for sample_test.csv. The output for test.csv must be formatted in the exact same way.\n","    Note: The predictions in the file might not be correct.\n","\n","Constraints:\n","\n","    You will be provided with a sample output file and a sanity checker file. Format your output to match the sample output file exactly and pass it through the sanity checker to ensure its validity.\n","    Note: If the file does not pass through the sanity checker, it will not be evaluated. You should receive a message like Parsing successful for file: ...csv if the output file is correctly formatted.\n","\n","    You are given the list of allowed units in constants.py and also in the Appendix. Your outputs must be in these units. Predictions using any other units will be considered invalid during validation.\n","\n","Evaluation Criteria:\n","\n","Submissions will be evaluated based on the F1 score, which is a standard measure of prediction accuracy for classification and extraction problems.\n","\n","Let GT = Ground truth value for a sample and OUT be the output prediction from the model for a sample. Then we classify the predictions into one of the 4 classes with the following logic:\n","\n","    True Positives: If OUT != \"\" and GT != \"\" and OUT == GT\n","    False Positives: If OUT != \"\" and GT != \"\" and OUT != GT\n","    False Positives: If OUT != \"\" and GT == \"\"\n","    False Negatives: If OUT == \"\" and GT != \"\"\n","    True Negatives: If OUT == \"\" and GT == \"\"\n","\n","Then,\n","F1 score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)\n","where:\n","\n","    Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n","    Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UigC43CFtPVY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importing libraries for data analysis\n","\n","import os\n","import requests\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","%matplotlib inline"],"metadata":{"id":"nNkyBDuAtQYp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726286050912,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1938,"user":{"displayName":"HARIOM PRAVIN SHIVHARE","userId":"18076407545436489760"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# mount the data folder from the drive\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","# Navigate to the shared folder\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab\\ Notebook/Amazon\\ ML\\ Challange/student_resource_3\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Vxoe373iqoHc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726286880004,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24485,"user":{"displayName":"HARIOM PRAVIN SHIVHARE","userId":"18076407545436489760"}},"outputId":"c5433cdc-d9de-4839-e4d8-def92c74993f"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebook/Amazon ML Challange/student_resource_3'\n","/content\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# change the current working directory\n","parent = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebook/Amazon ML Challange/'\n","resources = (os.path.join(parent, 'student_resource_3'))\n","src_folder = (os.path.join(parent, 'student_resource_3/src'))\n","dataset_folder = (os.path.join(parent, 'student_resource_3/dataset'))"],"metadata":{"id":"IO-bEMHKsr2W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726287272298,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":441,"user":{"displayName":"HARIOM PRAVIN SHIVHARE","userId":"18076407545436489760"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# download all the images for data analysis\n","\n","# folder where the images will be saved on Google Drive\n","images_folder = f\"{parent}/images\"\n","\n","# Create the folder if it doesn't exist\n","if not os.path.exists(images_folder):\n","    os.makedirs(images_folder)\n","\n","# read the\n","# Download each image and save it to the Drive folder\n","for i, url in enumerate(image_urls):\n","    try:\n","        # Get the image content from the URL\n","        response = requests.get(url)\n","        image_name = f'image_{i+1}.jpg'  # or extract image name from URL if needed\n","\n","        # Save the image to the Drive folder\n","        image_path = os.path.join(drive_folder, image_name)\n","        with open(image_path, 'wb') as f:\n","            f.write(response.content)\n","\n","        print(f'Downloaded {image_name}')\n","\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Failed to download {url}: {e}\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZmeLKU0StIgO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
